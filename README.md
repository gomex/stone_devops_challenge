# The Challenge

It's time to play now :)

To introduce you to our midgard (Tolkien feelings ^^) we need to know how much you are aligned with us,
to check that we have prepared a little challenge with some checkpoints that you need to reach.

Here is a list of what you will need to complete the challenge:
-   A computer with internet (hehe obvious isn't it ?)
-   Free account for <a href="https://goo.gl/1gzFRE" target="_blank">Microsoft Azure</a>, <a href="https://goo.gl/GQRLct" target="_blank">AWS (Amazon Web Services)</a>, or <a href="https://cloud.google.com" target="_blank">Google Cloud</a>

Okay, to the challenge now...

    Pretend that you are a DevOps Engineer at Stone Co. and your manager has designated you to help a new development team that will work in a revolutionary product for the company.
    After a few meetings with your new team, you have decided to use Jenkins as your CI/CD tool, your team chose to use Node.js  with React as the official tech stack.
	You are not sure on which cloud service you will use yet(that's why you need a free account of Azure or AWS, it's time to choose!)
	Your team needs a lab ready to test their first features.

Right, now that you have a hint of what your team needs, let's move forward.

- Once you clone this repo, you will note that we have a "source" folder, inside that folder you will find a  simple react application.
- To run this application you must do as follows:
 1. Run "npm install" command.
 2. Run "npm start" command.

Oh my God! there was a lot of information right ?

Yeah there was, but now you have all what you need to start the game.

Here are some of the checkpoints to guide you through this quest:
- You must rise a Jenkins application on any cloud service you chose.
- Your Jenkins server must be public so we can access with a user that you will provide (with administrator privilege please!).
- You must use slaves to run your builds on Jenkins.
- Your job must use continuous integration approach.
- Continuous deployment will be a plus.
- You must create a Jenkins job that will deploy your app.
- You might want to use Docker to run your application, if you choose this way it will be a plus, we like containers ;)

Once you have finished, you must send an email to challenge@stone.com.br with the following information:
- Jenkins URL with user and password (we might want to take a look in your job).
- Published app URL.
